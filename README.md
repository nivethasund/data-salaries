# Data Salaries Across Different Roles

The data source used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/data-scientist-salaries-8000-companies)

The aim of this project was to get the hang of cleaning raw data to work off of easily readable information. Some challenges with the raw data were,
- the salary values were all either formatted with commas or contained a range, eg 10T -16T, where T meant a thousand. So these values had to be edited to all appear as a float.
- Many of the roles were either misspelled or just not clear. Those roles have been edited to align with industry-standard role names.

Keep watching this space for my final analysis.
