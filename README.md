# Data Salaries Across Different Roles

The data source used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/data-scientist-salaries-8000-companies)

The aim of this project was to get the hang of cleaning raw data to work off of easily readable information. Some challenges with the raw data were,
- the salary values were all either formatted with commas or contained a range, eg 10T -16T, where T meant a thousand. So these values had to be edited to all appear as a float.
- Many of the roles were either misspelled or just not clear. Those roles have been edited to align with industry-standard role names.

In this repo, you'll find all the work done to clean the raw data in the Data Cleaning folder, along with the original CSV file.

The main_script file will contain my analysis of the cleaned data. So keep watching this space for my final analysis.
